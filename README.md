# Attention-Seeker




Overview:

Attention Seeker is an interactive device coded in **C++** that helps children with attention deficit improve focus in a fun and engaging way. The system provides simple challenges and feedback to encourage longer attention spans.  

Purpose:

Many children with attention deficit struggle with traditional focus exercises. The purpose of this project was to design an engaging and interactive tool that combines **play and learning** to help build focus skills in a positive environment.  


How It Works: 

Game Modes  
1. Stack

   - LEDs light up in sequence.  
   - The player must press the button that matches the color of the LED as it appears.  
   - Correct presses “stack” the colors, training focus and timing.  

3. Whack-a-Mole

   - A single LED lights up at random.  
   - The player must press the button that matches the color of the lit LED as quickly as possible.  
   - This improves reaction time and sustained attention.  

Simple Skills Practiced  
- Concentration on a single thing  
- Multitasking when switching between LEDs  
- Patience and sitting still while playing


Materials Used:

- Coded in C++
- Arduino microcontroller  
- 5 LED light strips
- 5 Arcade Buttons for user input
